# Lowest Common Ancestor

Find the lowest common ancestor of two items in a binary tree.

Assumptions:

Each value in the tree is unique (there are no two nodes with the same value).Each node has at most two children, left and right.You do not have a level&nbsp;attribute in each of your node (for example, 1st layer, 2nd layer, and so on).Each node has pointers to left and right children, but there's no back link (a child node does not point back to its parent node).


Example:

head = 5  
      / \  
     1   4  
    /\   /\  
   3  8 9  2  
  /\  
 6  7  

LCA of 8 and 7 is 1.LCA of 4 and 2 is 4.
