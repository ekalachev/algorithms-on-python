# Rotating a 2D Array by 90 Degrees

A 2-dimensional array is an array of arrays.

Implement a function that takes a square 2D array (# columns = # rows) and rotates it by 90 degrees.

Example:

[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

-&gt;

[[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]

When you are done, try implementing this function so that you can solve this problem in place.
Solving it in place means that your function won't create a new array to solve this problem.  Instead, modify the content of the given array with O(1) extra space.



NOTE: For simplicity, we're going to represent a 2 dimensional array as a list of lists in Python.
