# Common Elements in Two Sorted Arrays (Python)

Write a function that returns the common elements (as an array) between two sorted arrays of integers (ascending order).

Example: The common elements between [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9] and [1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10] are [1, 4, 9].

REMINDER: We're going to use lists instead of arrays in Python for simplicity.
