# Most Frequently Occurring Item in an Array (Python)

Find the most frequently occurring item in an array.

Example: The most frequently occurring item in [1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1] is 1.

If you're given an empty array, you should return null (in Java) or None (in Python).

You can assume that there is always a single, unique value that appears most frequently unless the array is empty.  For instance, you won't be given an array such as [1, 1, 2, 2].

NOTE: We're going to use lists instead of arrays in Python for simplicity.
