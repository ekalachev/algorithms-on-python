# Non-Repeating Character (Python)
Implement a function that takes a string and returns the first character that does not appear twice or more.
# Example:
- "abacc" - 'b' ('a' appears twice, and so does 'c')
- "xxyzx" - 'y' ('y' and 'z' are non-repeating characters, and 'y' appears first)
- If there is no non-repeating character, return None.
